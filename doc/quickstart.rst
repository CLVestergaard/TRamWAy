Quick Start Guide
=================

InferenceMAP is a feature-rich library written in Python. It is primarily intented to be imported as such. Its high-level routines are described in the :ref:`first section <quickstart.helpers>` of this page.

InferenceMAP also features a :ref:`command-line interface <quickstart.commandline>` for limited usage outside of the Python language.

In both cases, you may be interested in reading the generated ``.h5`` data files. Their format is described in the :ref:`last section <quickstart.formats>` of this page.
