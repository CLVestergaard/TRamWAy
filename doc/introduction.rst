Introduction
============

This re-implementation of InferenceMAP for now focuses on meshing the space of the moving particles, as a preliminary step for infering spatial maps of diffusivity and potential.

**Disclaimer:**
This implementation is under heavy development and is not yet suitable even for testing purposes!
To get the official implementation, please follow [this link](https://research.pasteur.fr/en/software/inferencemap/ "research.pasteur.fr/en/software/inferencemap").
