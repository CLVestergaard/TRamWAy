InferenceMAP documentation
==========================

|inferencemap| helps analyzing single molecule dynamics. It infers the diffusivity, drift, force and potential across space and time.

|inferencemap| as for its stable version by now is based on Bayesian analysis of Random Walks. In addition to estimating spatial maps of physical parameters, it can generate large amounts of trajectories in the inferred maps using the master equation approximation of the Fokker-Planck describing the motion.

Finally, |inferencemap| provides multiple representations of both raw data and inferred fields.

.. warning::

   This implementation is under heavy development and is not yet suitable even for testing purposes!

   Most notably, the proper inference logic is not fully implemented yet!

   You can get the stable version `here <https://research.pasteur.fr/en/software/inferencemap/>`_.
