Installation
============

You will need Python >= 2.7 or >= 3.5.

::

	git clone https://github.com/influencecell/inferencemap
	cd inferencemap
	pip install .


``pip install`` will install some Python dependencies if missing, but you may still need to install the [HDF5 reference library](https://support.hdfgroup.org/downloads/index.html "support.hdfgroup.org/downloads").
